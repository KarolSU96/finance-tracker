# Django Finance Tracker

This is my milestone 4 project of the Code Institute Full Stack Web Development Course.
The goal of the project is to build a Full-Stack Web application using an MVC (Model-Template-View) framework.
Finance Tracker is a web applicaton for managing your financial expenses which utilises Django as a framework.

This tracker should provide everyone with a simple tool to plan their monthly budget or maybe a even their next vacation.


## UX 


### Design
This web app is responsive and work well on both desktop and mobile devices.
I focussed on simplicity and clearity of the page. Just the key features available.

### Colour Scheme
Blue white black // notes needed 


### Typography
The font used throughout the application is Lato, which means summer in polish.
It's a sans serif typeface, designed in Summer 2010 by Lukas Dziedzic.
It has a fresh, aesthetic and is highly readable.
