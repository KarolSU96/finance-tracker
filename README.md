# Django Finance Tracker

This is my milestone 4 project of the Code Institute Full Stack Web Development Course.
The goal of the project is to build a Full-Stack Web application using an MVC (Model-Template-View) framework.
Finance Tracker is a web applicaton for managing your financial expenses which utilises Django as a framework.

This tracker should provide everyone with a simple tool to plan their monthly budget or maybe a even their next vacation.


## UX 

The finance tracker has simple and easy to use design. The colour aesthetic and font work well together and have a modern aesthetic.
The pages are responsive and apporpriate for all devices. The functionality stays the same on both mobile and desktop.


### Design
Thanks to Bootstrap the pages stay responsive and look good on all devices.


### Typography
The font used throughout the application is Lato, which means summer in polish.
It's a sans serif typeface, designed in Summer 2010 by Lukas Dziedzic.
It has a fresh, aesthetic and is highly readable.

## Bugs

How great would it be to not be restrictedby time? Unfortunatley for us, 3 dimensional beings, the time flows and I didn't have enough of it to fix all the bugs. So here they are:
- SweetAlerts notifications taking a bit too much space on mobile. I tired numerous ways to style it differently but nothing has worked yet. In the docs it says that the width should be editable when we fire the swal as one of the properties of the object. Will defenitely fix this in the future when I have time.
- Plan table is a bit too big on some mobile devices. It still displays the informations nicely but sometimes the nuser needs to scroll a bit to the right, to see the plan description for example.

## Technologies Used
- HTML 5 for structuring the markup text
- CSS3 used for styling, altough most of the styling was done with Bootstrap
- JavaScript - used for displaying the notifications
- Django: Web framework for Pyhton
- Bootstrap: Front-end framework
- SweetAlert: Customizable alerts for better user experience
- Git Hub used for secure online code storage
- Codeanywhere used as a cloud-based IDE for developlment
